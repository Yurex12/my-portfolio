        <p>
          I’m a Fullstack Developer passionate about building software that
          solves real problems. My curiosity about technology evolved into a
          dedication to crafting digital experiences that merge design thinking
          with robust functionality.

          Over time, I’ve worked with modern web technologies to build scalable
          and maintainable applications. I enjoy turning ideas into clean,
          efficient code and continuously learning new tools that improve how
          products are designed, developed, and delivered
